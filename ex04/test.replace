Lonely, open,Merhaba vast and Merhaba free,
The dark’ning desert Merhabalies;
The wind sweeps o’er it fiercely,
And the yellow sandMerhaba flies. Merhaba
The tortuous trail is hidden,
Ere the sand-storm has passed
With all its wild, mad shriekings,
Borne shrilly on its blast.

Are they fiends or are they demons
