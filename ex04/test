Lonely, open,enes vast and enes free,
The dark’ning desert eneslies;
The wind sweeps o’er it fiercely,
And the yellow sandenes flies. enes
The tortuous trail is hidden,
Ere the sand-storm has passed
With all its wild, mad shriekings,
Borne shrilly on its blast.

Are they fiends or are they demons
That wail weirdly as they go,
